### 5.1 Integers and Floating-Point Numbers ###

# Check for the data type with type()
# integers do not have a maximum size
# you can use _ to space out the digits in an integer
# floats have a maximum size
# you can denote x10 as e for float data types
# 2e400 is the maximum floating point number
# python will return inf for the float
# inf means infinity
# python also has -inf

# #1
num1 = 25000000
num2 = 25_000_000

print(num1)
print(num2)

# #2
num = 1.75e5
print(num)

# #3
# no
