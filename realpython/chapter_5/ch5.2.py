### 5.2 Arithmetic Operators and Expressions ###

# operator and operands
# operands don't need to be integers
# adding a float with an int will make a float
# the only operator that always returns a float is /
# must int(a/b) if you want an integer, but it discards the fractional part
# integer division or floor division //
# // rounds down to the nearest integer, which behaves differently for +ve and -ve numbs
# // returns a float if an operand is a float, but it still rounds down
# you cannot divide by 0
# exponents are with **
# although the result of an exponent might be an integer, python will ret a float
# if a float was an operand
# % assed modulus operator
# modulo with negative is trippy
# for x % y,
# r = x - (y * (x // y))
# for complex expressions it's a good idea to put the multiplication operators
# next to operands so it's easier to read
