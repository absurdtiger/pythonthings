# 8.6 recover from errors

# listing the types of errors
# ValueError
# 	when the operation encounters an invalid value, such as converting a string to an integer
# TypeError
# 	when operation is performed on wrong value
# 	e.g. trying to add a string and int
# NameError
# 	when var name hasn't been defined
# ZeroDivisionError
# 	when divisor is 0
# OverflowError
# 	when result of math is too large

# if you anticipate an exception to occur, you can catch the error

# or you can use except (ExampleError, AnotherExampleError):
# you can write multiple except blocks after try

# if error is unspecified, any error at all will execute except
